# Amazon-review-s-Summarization
In this project, we explore the application of deep learning techniques for text
summarization. We investigate both extractive and abstractive summarization methods and analyze
their performance. The project aims to contribute to the field of natural language processing by
enhancing the efficiency and quality of text summarization techniques. Our objective is to build a text
summarizer where the input is a long sequence of words (in a text body), and the output is a short
summary (which is a sequence as well). So, we can model this as a Many-to-Many Seq2Seq problem.
Our aim of the project is to employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to develop an efficient
text summarization system. Our LSTM model is optimized to capture context and sequential patterns,
enhancing its ability to summarize text
